# What's this about?
So I saw a video about a game called ["Calculate It"](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3043740/Calculate_It/). A rougelike game about calculating. The base game mechanic is a limit for each button and a shop where you can re-buy these buttons, among some new ones. The person playing the game sometimes said things along the lines of "I don't think I am playing the most optimal way". That got me thinking. There are some buttons that have random effects, but most of them are strictly defined in their function ("+" never devide the number; unlike "add random ammount between 1 and 10" or "add use to random button"). Since most of the game's solutions are predictable, could I create a program that finds the most optimal solution to a given set of buttons that are allowed and a inital number that needs to be turned into a given target number? Well this project contains my attempts at finding out if I could.
